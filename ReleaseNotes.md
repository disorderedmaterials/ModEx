Initial Release of ModEx.
Currently only working on OSX and Linux.
Offers two binary executables: partition_events and modulation_excitation.
partition_events: partitions events (with relative times) by spectra in a given spectra range.
modulation_excitation: performs pre-processing of event mode data from Nexus files, given a defined configuration.
